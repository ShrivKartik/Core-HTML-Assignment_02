    <p>
       Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website <br>
       in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing <br>
       process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing <br>
       essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website <br>
       is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. <br> 
       All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed. <br>
